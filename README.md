# Austin house pricing analysis
## Project Proposal:
The objective of this project will be to predict house pricing in Austin, TX based on property features like location, size, and ammenities. 
We will also build a web page in which we will show different visualizations of the data to observe general trends before going into machine learning predictions. 

### Visualizations to be considered:
- Pie chart:
- Scatter plot for mean price by zip code or neighborhood 
- Map of the city in form og heatmap
-
